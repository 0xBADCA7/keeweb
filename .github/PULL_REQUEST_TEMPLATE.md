Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :gift:

Please follow these steps:

1. make sure the feature you add not listed in [banned features](https://github.com/antelle/keeweb/wiki/Unsupported-Features)
2. check compatibility with [the project roadmap](https://github.com/antelle/keeweb/wiki/TODO) and key features: you should not break anything
3. if your feature is introducing a lot of new UI, or is changing any UX or design concept, please, open an issue to discuss it first
4. please, respect existing style in code, styles and markup (hint: install and enable [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) in your editor)
5. don't add any dependencies
6. test your code: it must work in browser, Windows, OSX and Linux
7. if your code is platform-dependent, please add corresponding switches
8. respect each platform: don't create behaviour which breaks interface guidelines or user expectations 
9. run `grunt` and make sure it's passing
